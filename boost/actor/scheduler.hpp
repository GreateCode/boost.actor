/**
 * @brief A work-stealing scheduling worker.
 *
 * The work-stealing implementation of Boost.Actor minimizes access to the
 * synchronized queue. The reasoning behind this design decision is that it
 * has been shown that stealing actually is very rare for most workloads [1].
 * Hence, implementations should focus on the performance in
 * the non-stealing case. For this reason, each worker has an exposed
 * job queue that can be accessed by the central scheduler instance as
 * well as other workers, but it also has a private job list it is
 * currently working on. To account for the load balancing aspect, each
 * worker makes sure that at least one job is left in its exposed queue
 * to allow other workers to steal it.

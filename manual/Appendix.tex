\subsection{Using \texttt{aout} -- A Concurrency-safe Wrapper for \texttt{cout}}

When using \lstinline^cout^ from multiple actors, output often appears interleaved.
Moreover, using \lstinline^cout^ from multiple actors -- and thus from multiple threads -- in parallel should be avoided regardless, since the standard does not guarantee a thread-safe implementation.

By replacing \texttt{std::cout} with \texttt{cppa::aout}, actors can achieve a concurrency-safe text output.
The header \lstinline^cppa/cppa.hpp^ also defines overloads for \texttt{std::endl} and \texttt{std::flush} for \lstinline^aout^, but does not support the full range of ostream operations (yet).
Each write operation to \texttt{aout} sends a message to a `hidden' actor (keep in mind, sending messages from actor constructors is not safe).
This actor only prints lines, unless output is forced using \lstinline^flush^.
The example below illustrates printing of lines of text from multiple actors (in random order).

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <chrono>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include "cppa/cppa.hpp"

using namespace cppa;
using std::endl;

int main() {
    std::srand(std::time(0));
    for (int i = 1; i <= 50; ++i) {
        spawn<blocking_api>([i](blocking_actor* self) {
          aout(self) << "Hi there! This is actor nr. "
                     << i << "!" << endl;
          std::chrono::milliseconds tout{std::rand() % 1000};
          self->delayed_send(self, tout, atom("done"));
          self->receive(others() >> [i, self] {
              aout(self) << "Actor nr. "
                         << i << " says goodbye!" << endl;
          });
        });
    }
    // wait until all other actors we've spawned are done
    await_all_actors_done();
    // done
    shutdown();
    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
